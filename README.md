# Modified SVM Method Research Project

## Overview
This project introduces a novel classification method that enhances the traditional Support Vector Machine (SVM) approach, particularly focusing on scenarios involving noisy data. The proposed method aims to improve generalization performance, especially in the realm of medical data analysis, by eliminating the need for selecting a suitable kernel and incorporating the H^1 inner product space.

## Purpose
The primary goal of this research project is to enhance the classification performance of SVMs by leveraging the H^1 inner product space and multi-objective optimization techniques. By integrating the weak derivative information along with function values, the proposed method addresses challenges posed by noisy and linearly inseparable data, ultimately improving classification accuracy and generalization performance.

## Approach
- Introduction of the modified SVM method that shifts the inner product space to H^1 space for handling noisy and non-linearly separable data.
- Formulation of multi-objective optimization problems to optimize the classification process in the feature space.
- Incorporation of weak derivatives and inner product within Sobolev space to capture local variations and gradients in the data for defining more intricate decision boundaries.

## Key Findings
- The proposed method eliminates the need for kernel selection in SVMs, enhancing generalization performance on unseen data.
- Leveraging the H^1 inner product space enables improved handling of noisy and linearly inseparable data.
- The multi-objective optimization approach coupled with weak derivatives enhances the SVM method's ability to deal with complex data distributions and achieve precise classifications.
- Integration of Sobolev space as a regularizer promotes uniformity, noise robustness, and better adaptability to variations in the dataset.

## Future Work
- Further optimization and convergence analysis of the proposed method.
- Exploration of applications in different domains beyond medical data analysis.
- Performance comparison with existing SVM approaches and other classification methods.
- Expansion of the method to handle higher-order derivatives and more complex data structures.
